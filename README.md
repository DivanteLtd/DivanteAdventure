# Adventure - Open HRM

**Adventure is a kind of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) for service-oriented and/or software companies.** 
It's internally used at Divante eCommerce Company. It's a central communication and planning system where our HR,
Administration, and Finance departments process the necessary data about employees, projects, skills, and assignments.
It's neither the HRM neither the CRM. It's both with enterprise intranet features for managing the internal relationship
with all the necessary information at the management team's disposal, including information on signed consents, planned
holidays, and many others.

We feel that many other service-oriented companies might have pretty much the same needs therefore we decided to Open
Source our project. Please find the full features list in the index below.
